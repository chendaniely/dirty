tidyr -> dirty

"tidyr" is an anagram of "dirty". Let's undo all of Hadley's hard work and make data dirty again.

###### Why do all the tutorials you see use the same datasets?

Because publicly available datasets that can be freely distributed and can also be used for commercial purposes are extremely limited and difficult and hard to find.
Datasets that are "dirty" for a specific teaching example are also difficult to find as well.
This package fixes these issues by taking any dataset and makes it "dirty".
