This will be a package that dirties data in R. Motivation: we built a course on cleaning data and it was really tough to find dirty datasets that were licensed for commercial use. The point of this package is to construct such datasets that can be used for pedagogical purposes.


# dirty
tidyr -> dirty

"tidyr" is an anagram of "dirty". Let's undo all of Hadley's hard work and make data dirty again.

###### Why do all the tutorials you see use the same datasets?

Because publicly available datasets that can be freely distributed and can also be used for commercial purposes are extremely limited and difficult and hard to find.
Datasets that are "dirty" for a specific teaching example are also difficult to find as well.
This package fixes these issues by taking any dataset and makes it "dirty".
